# Lung Tumour Tracer

My solution for the HMS Lung Tumour Tracer Competition organized by TopCoder. It consists of two stacked deep networks. The first networks
takes as an input 3 images of consecutive slices from a patient CT Scan and outputs a mask of the lungs. The second networks segments the tumorous
pixels from the cropped lung regions.
